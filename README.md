Hey! Igor Lomakin is with you again. And you see my third project with the Hexlet team. This is the final draft related to layout. The big challenge was setting up the environment to implement it. As a result, the project was implemented using the Pug and SASS preprocessors, the Bootstrap framework, and all this was assembled using Gulp.
